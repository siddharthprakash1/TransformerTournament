GAME RULES:
1. The game is played on an 8x8 grid.
2. Players take turns placing pieces on empty cells.
3. When you place a piece, you capture any ADJACENT opponent pieces (up, down, left, right).
4. Adjacent means sharing an edge, not just a corner.
5. The game ends when the board is full.
6. The player with the most pieces wins.

CAPTURE MECHANICS:
- When you place a piece at position (r,c), you capture any opponent pieces at (r+1,c), (r-1,c), (r,c+1), and (r,c-1).
- You do NOT capture diagonally adjacent pieces.
- You only capture pieces that are directly adjacent to your newly placed piece.

CURRENT GAME STATE:
Board (X=player1, O=player2, Â·=empty):
{board_str}

You are player {current_player} ({'X' if current_player == 1 else 'O'}).
Current score: Player 1 (X): {player1_count}, Player 2 (O): {player2_count}
Game phase: {phase}

{move_history_str}

VALID MOVES (with capture analysis):
{valid_moves_str}

ADVANCED STRATEGY TIPS:
{strategy_tips}

SPECIAL POSITIONS:
- CORNERS (0,0), (0,7), (7,0), (7,7): Most valuable positions, should be prioritized
- EDGES: Second most valuable, hard for opponent to capture
- NEAR CORNERS: Avoid placing pieces adjacent to empty corners, as they give opponent access to corners
- CENTER CONTROL: Important in early game to establish position

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Analyze the board carefully
2. Choose the move that maximizes your long-term advantage
3. Return ONLY a JSON object with your chosen move, like this:
{{"row": 3, "col": 4, "reasoning": "This move captures 2 pieces and controls an important strategic position"}}
